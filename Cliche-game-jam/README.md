## Dev-Log
* **11-09-2022**
> Not sure why, but yesterday I decided I wanted to mess around with my debian partition, to create some network drives. Well, that didn't work out as simple as I thought and I ended up having to wipe it. Did a clean Fedora wipe and am now production-ready.
>> Working till late tonight! Hope to have something soon! I can already see that this isn't going to have much gameplay by the end of the month!!! >:-{
>>> We'll figure it out. **CB**

* **11-06-2022:**
> Due to time constraints, development began today, *5 days late*.
> Spent the majority of the time setting up repos and 
> standardizing software across my 2 devices.
>> Godot Engine was considered to create crossplay between my Windows and Linux laptops.
> The final theme for game has not been decided.
>> Will work on a few prototypes first! ***-CB***
